-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spite House (soon to be located at spite-house.com) is a music review app for users to come together and openly criticize music they don't find particularly interesting.

The definition of a Spite House is "a building constructed or substantially modified to irritate neighbors or any party with land stakes. Because long-term occupation is not the primary purpose of these houses, they frequently sport strange and impractical structures."
